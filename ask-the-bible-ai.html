                    <h2>What is Ask the Bible AI?</h2>
                    <p><strong>Ask the Bible AI</strong> is an advanced artificial intelligence tool designed to answer questions about the Christian Bible. Whether you're studying theology, exploring ethical questions, or seeking guidance on current events, this Bible AI provides clear, cited answers from scripture.</p>
                    <p>When you <strong>ask the Bible AI</strong> a question, the system uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to find the most relevant passages from both the Old and New Testaments. It then provides a comprehensive answer with specific citations like "John 3:16" or "Matthew 5:3-12," along with context and interpretation.</p>
                    <p>Unlike generic chatbots, <strong>ask the Bible AI</strong> is specifically trained on biblical texts and their contexts. It understands the difference between different books, recognizes historical context, and can explain how various passages relate to your question.</p>
