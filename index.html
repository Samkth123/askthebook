                        <p>Ask the Holy Book provides three specialized AI services: <strong>ask the Bible AI</strong>, <strong>ask the Quran AI</strong>, and <strong>ask the Torah AI</strong>. Each service is designed to answer your questions with accuracy, respect, and proper citations.</p>
                        <p>When you <strong>ask the Bible AI</strong>, you receive answers grounded in both Old and New Testament passages, with chapter-and-verse references. The <strong>ask the Quran AI</strong> service draws from the Holy Quran's surahs and verses, providing context and interpretation. When you <strong>ask the Torah AI</strong>, responses come from the first five books of the Hebrew Bible—Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.</p>
                        <p>All three AI services use advanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to find the most relevant passages for your question, then provide clear, cited answers. Whether you're studying theology, exploring ethical questions, or seeking guidance on current events, these AI tools help you understand what the sacred texts say.</p>

                        <p>One of the most powerful features of Ask the Holy Book is the ability to <strong>ask the Bible and Quran compare</strong> answers side by side. This comparison tool lets you see how both traditions address the same question, revealing similarities and differences in their teachings.</p>

                        <p>This comparison feature is invaluable for interfaith dialogue, academic study, and personal exploration. You can also compare all three traditions—Bible, Quran, and Torah—to see how they collectively address complex questions about justice, leadership, forgiveness, and more.</p>
