                    <h2>What is Ask the Torah AI?</h2>
                    <p><strong>Ask the Torah AI</strong> is an advanced artificial intelligence tool designed to answer questions about the Torah—the first five books of the Hebrew Bible: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. Whether you're studying Jewish theology, exploring ethical questions, or seeking guidance on current events, this Torah AI provides clear, cited answers from scripture.</p>
                    <p>When you <strong>ask the Torah AI</strong> a question, the system uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to find the most relevant passages from these foundational texts. It then provides a comprehensive answer with specific citations like "Genesis 1:1" or "Exodus 20:1-17," along with context and interpretation.</p>
                    <p>Unlike generic chatbots, <strong>ask the Torah AI</strong> is specifically trained on Torah texts and their contexts. It understands the difference between different books, recognizes historical context, and can explain how various passages relate to your question.</p>
